<h1>IPS School Survey Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was created during one of my classes at Butler University. For this project, I partnered with Indianapolis public schools to distribute a survey and create a Tableau dashboard to effectively communicate my findings. Although the data displayed is not the same as the original survey data, the dashboard shown is the same dashboard that I presented to the Indianapolis public school board. You can access the Tableau workbook file above, or click on this <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/IPSDashboard_17057077206150/Home?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Link</a> to view the dashboard in Tableau public. Additionally, you can refer to the images below for a static view of the dashboard.
